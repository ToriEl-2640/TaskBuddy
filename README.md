## How Kiro was used
This project uses Kiro to enhance the development process by:

* Managing specs and hooks inside the .kiro directory for streamlined testing and task management

* Implementing hooks that trigger actions during task lifecycle events (add, toggle, delete)

* Steering the project flow with Kiro’s declarative specifications, enabling clean integration of features and ensuring consistency

* Tracking progress and debugging through Kiro’s hooks during development

The .kiro directory contains the project specs and hooks configuration files which integrate directly with the Python backend, enabling a smooth developer experience and automated checks.
